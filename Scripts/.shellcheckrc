# SC2086: zsh has different word-split semantics
#
#  I use this to keep parameters expanded as I pass them around:
#
#    ../configure $CONFIG_FLAGS
#
disable=SC2086

# SC2128: zsh fully expands an array without any special index syntax
#
#   I use this to define parameters as arrays, for cleanliness and readability, then
#   squash/concatenate them into a string to be passed to configure/make:
#
#   var_arr=( a b c )
#   var="$var_arr"
#
disable=SC2128

# SC2206: zsh has different array semantics
#
#  I use this to build up parameters with arrays:
#
#    CXXFLAGS_A=($CFLAGS_A -Wno-deprecated-register)
#
disable=SC2206
