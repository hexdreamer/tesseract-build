# Build products and Xcode Modules

All Tesseract-related build products are installed here, in **Root**.  

Root is the location for all referenced headers and modules, and libraries, in the iOCR Xcode project.  **include/module.modulemap** defines modules that iOCR will use, and is covered in [Configuring Xcode](../iOCR/README.md).
